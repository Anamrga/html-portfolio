<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>6 years of experience in the field of industrial design. Self-taught and highly adaptable to new tools</p>

<p>Extensive experience in prototyping. I initially started as a CAD Designer and Project Engineer at Baepack, where I participated in the conceptualization, development (using Solidworks) of various cardboard and plastic packaging machines. Depending on the product, the machine processes involved pneumatics, electric axes, or simply folded shafts (e.g., for folding the cardboard).</p>

<p>I was also responsible for organizing and distributing this work for both external and internal production at the factory.</p>

<p>With experience in overcoming the challenge of adapting the machine to last-minute client demands and product materials.</p>

<p>As for adapting to new tools, I am highly flexible. For instance, at Mecondielle, I had to learn how to operate the CNC machine, and at Baepack, I also needed to learn how to operate the 3D printer for testing purposes. Additionally, since we were a small team, I also learned video editing and photography for advertising purposes.</p>

<p>I have started learning Figma, HTML, CSS, and Python on my own to acquire new skills.</p>

<p>Being self-taught in these areas has allowed me to explore and expand my knowledge in design, web development, and programming. Figma has become my go-to tool for creating stunning visual designs and prototypes. With HTML and CSS, I have been able to bring these designs to life by building responsive and interactive websites. Python, on the other hand, has opened up a whole new world of possibilities in terms of backend development and data manipulation.</p>

<p>While the learning process has its challenges, I have found immense satisfaction in acquiring these skills independently. It has given me the freedom to set my own pace, delve deeper into areas that interest me the most, and experiment with different projects and ideas.</p>

<p>I am eager to take on new challenges and acquire additional skills.</p>
